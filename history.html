<h3>Master League</h3>
<p style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.404);">In the Master League, you create and manage your own team with the aim of becoming the strongest team in the league competing against the computer teams in a round-robin tournament. It was first introduced to the game in ISS Pro Evolution in 1999, which was also the first in the series (counting earlier releases Goal Storm, Goal Storm 97 and International Superstar Soccer Pro 98) to feature club teams for the express purpose of composing the Master League.
    <br>
Prior to PES 2010 there were four leagues, each split into four divisions of 20 teams and the league that you compete in has a Division 2 which featured 8 teams up till PES 2008 where 18 teams featured in Division 2 in the Next Gen consoles. (They stayed the same in the PS2 version until PES 2009 when 12 teams were included in the Division 2). Teams are promoted or relegated depending on their results, and high performance teams are invited to take part in big tournaments, previously known as the WEFA Championships and Masters Cup but since PES 2009 teams feature in the licensed Champions League and Europa League. The UEFA Super Cup was introduced in PES 2011
    
    The Master League never ends. You can keep playing until your team gets to the level your ambition drives it to. Before PES 2010, there were 3 choices when you go into the mode:
    
    Pick Master League Default Players where you can chose an existing team with Master League Default Players.
    Match Mode Players where you can chose an existing team with full squads.
    Create Original Team where you can create a team from scratch (This mode was removed in PES 2011)except for the Wii and Psp versions.</p>
